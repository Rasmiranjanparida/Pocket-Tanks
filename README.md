Pocket Tanks Java Project
Project Overview
Pocket Tanks is an action-packed, overhead shooter game where players control heavily armored tanks battling against enemy vehicles, turrets, and other threats. The game is inspired by other popular tank games like World of Tanks, and offers a fun, multiplayer experience. Players can register, join, and compete in tank battles where they shoot projectiles to cause damage to each other’s tanks and earn points based on proximity and damage dealt.

Game Description
Player 1:
The first player registers and waits for another player to join the game.
Players take turns shooting projectiles at each other’s tanks. The closer the projectile lands to the opponent, the more points they earn.
If the projectile damages the ground near the tank, the player loses points.
The total score is accumulated over time, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
Player 2:
The second player registers and joins the game after Player 1.
Both players take turns shooting projectiles and accumulating scores, as mentioned above.
Admin Module:
The admin module handles tasks such as deleting or modifying user information.
Future work includes adding features like blocking or banning users.
Technology Stack
Frontend:
Eclipse Helios: Used for the development of the game.
Eclipse Europa: An alternative version of Eclipse used for Java development.
Backend:
MySQL: A relational database used to store user data, including registration and login details.
SQL: Used for querying the database to manage user data.
User Interface:
HTML Forms: Used for creating the login and registration forms for the game.
JSP: Java Server Pages used to render the login and registration pages.
Java Servlet: Facilitates the interaction between users and the backend, including user login and registration processes.
Game Mechanics:
Java Applet: The game itself is handled by a Java Applet, which renders the game on an HTML page.
Future Work
The admin module will be expanded to include the ability to block or ban users on the server.
The game may be enhanced with more interactive features and additional gameplay modes.
